    "First, we distinguish between a `Task` object and a `Label` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Label` object represents only the _label_ data for a training example, decoupled from the input image entirely. This could be a list of points as in `PersonPoseLabel`, or a numpy array as in `SegmentationLabel`, or a list of bounding boxes as in `ObjectLabel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Task` is a coupling of a _label_ with an input _data_: it is essentially a pair, consisting of the input to the model and the ground truth. For instance, a `SegmentationTask` has two attributes: the `data` (a `np.array` representing an image) and the `label` (a `SegmentationLabel`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A `MultiTask` is a coupling of an input _data_ with _multiple labels_. This way, we only need to store _one copy_ of the input data for _multiple different task types_. A `MultiTask` instance consists of two attributes: the `data` (a `np.array` representing an image), and a `labels` list, containing multiple different `Label` objects for multiple different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `Task` object comes with a `show()`, which displays the input data (image) along with its label(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `Label` object comes with a `collate()` classmethod, which determines how to collate multiple different labels into a single batched object."

    "## Transforms\n",
    "The basic callable object, designed to handle multitask data, is a subclass of `AbstractMultiTaskTransform`. These objects, sometimes referred to as \"transforms\", are meant to be \"smart functions\" which can figure out what type of input they receive, and how to transform that input based on its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general workflow is as follows:\n",
    "1. Implement the `get_shared_parameters` abstract method.\n",
    "2. Implement various `__call__` functions for the input _data_ type (in our case, an image, represented by an `nd.array`), and the input _label_ types (`SegmentationLabel`, `ObjectLabel`, etc.).\n",

    "* Use your transform on `MultiTask` data,\n",
    "* use your transform on single `Task` data,\n",
